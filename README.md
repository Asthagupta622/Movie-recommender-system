1.Introduction
This project implements a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.
It leverages the power of machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and movie attributes to make personalized recommendations.

# Features
User-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user similarity.
Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on movie similarity.
Content-based Filtering: Recommends movies based on movie attributes (genre, actors, etc.).
Hybrid Recommender: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.
Interactive Jupyter Notebooks: Explore the project and its implementation in an interactive manner.
API Integration: Expose the recommendation system via an API for easy integration with other applications.

# Datasets
The project uses the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset:

TMDB Dataset: Contains comprehensive information about movies, including metadata like genre, director, cast, ratings, and more.

# Installation
